%Coordinator: Vincent ISOZ
%Last Update: 2018-01-20
%Contact: info@sciences.ch
%Compiled on: TeXMaker 5.0.2 x64/MiKTeX 2.9 / Package Update 2018-01-20/Microsoft Windows 10 Creator Update x64/PC 16GB RAM (recommanded otherwise the document could not compiled correctly or not at all without deactivating the LOF and LOT!)

%Remarks: 

%R1. The tkz-tab and etex packages must be installed manually from the MikTeX Package Manager!!!

%R2. When you install first MiKTeX and after TeXMaker don't forget to reboot computer. Compile the document (probably will fail first time...). Do an update of packages using the MiKTeX package updater. Try compile again and use once again de MiKTeX package update. And it should work! If it still don't work i have notice that sometimes corrupted images cause the compilation to not be possible.

%R3. Try using a less as possible styles and math operators to avoid confusion (thanks).

%R4. Since 2015-08-29 the ctable package makes conflicts and therefore you can't compile the document with it anymore. We have commented it.

%R5. When the MikTeX Updater updates the BibTex package, then you have to remove all temporary compilation files of the book to be able to compile it again.

%R6. Above 2,600 pages the MikTeX compilation reach TeX memory limit. You will get the message:
%TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [main memory size=3000000]
%To solve this open a command Window or the PowerShell and enter:
%initexmf --edit-config-file=pdflatex
%Add the following line in the new document that appears on the screen:
%pool_size=5000000
%main_memory=6000000
%extra_mem_bot=2000000
%font_mem_size=2000000
%and save it (ctrl+s) and quit the editor. After rebuild the format with:
%initexmf --dump=pdflatex
%that's it!!!!
%R6. To remove all equation in Notepad++ with a RegEx, use:
% (?s)\\begin\{gather\}.*?\\end\{gather\}
%don't forget to activate the field ". match newlines"

	\chapter{Acknowledgements}

	The ideas in this book have been developed and reinforced by many people. I have greatly benefited from my regular interactions with  students (university, engineering schools) and executives from all backgrounds, including CEOs, CFOs, PMs of many companies around the world, teaching sessions, developing company-specific programs, consulting, and even informal conversations. I am grateful to them for sharing their wisdom with me and inspiring many of the ideas in the book.

	This book and its companion website would not have been possible without the valuable support of the people mentioned below. They find here the expression of my gratitude (and for sure if some errors remains in this book this is obviously their fault...):
	
	\begin{itemize}		
		\item \textbf{HARMEL Léon }(†2012), graduate electrical engineer with a specialization in electronics and automation, responsible in the physical research laboratory at ACEC in Charleroi (BEL), for the provision of documentation that was used in the sections of Corpuscular Quantum Physics, Wave Quantum Physics,  Quantum Field Theory, Spinor calculus and General Relativity.
		
		\item \textbf{KOLANI Daname}, Ph.D. student in portfolio management at UM5-Rabat (MAR) for his help on the redaction of the R and MATLAB™ companion books, proofreading and complements of the section in this book about data mining and machine learning and translation of a few hundred pages of the original french website into this \LaTeX{} book.
		
		\item \textbf{LEGRAND Mathias}, Ph.D. of the École Centrale de Nantes (FRA) for his help on the translation of the first $550$  pages of the original french website into this \LaTeX{} book.
		
		\item \textbf{RICCHIUTO Ruben}, engineer degree in physics HES (B.Sc.) from the Engineering School of Geneva (CHE) and mathematician from the University of Geneva for his valuable help in plasma physics, electromagnetism, quantum physics, statistics, topology, quantum chemistry, fractals theory, analysis and many other areas affecting pure mathematics and computing.
		
		\item Regulars users of \href{http://www.les-mathematiques.net}{{\color{blue} Les Mathematiques.net}} and \href{http://www.futura-sciences.com}{{\color{blue} Futura-Sciences.com}} forum, for their valuable assistance in many areas of mathematics and physics. The debates and discussions that took place on the forums helps to constantly improve the educational aspect of this book.
		
		\item The \href{http://www.wikipedia.com}{{\color{blue} Wikipedia}} and \href{http://www.planetmath.com}{{\color{blue} PlanetMath}} websites to whom I am indebted to many borrow almost word by word (and this is mutual...).
		
		\item The professors Gabriel Nagy of Michigan State University, Liam Revell of Massachusetts Boston University, Jorge Cham (of PhD Comics) and the OpenStax team that have received \underline{and} read my multiple e-mails inquiries about images credits and texts credits but that never answered to me (not quite good examples of what should be the "scientific collaboration and spirit"...)
	\end{itemize}
	
	And thanks to all readers, webmasters and teachers for their websites and quality documents available for free and anonymously on the Internet and regular forum stakeholders. I sometimes verbatim recovered their explanations that do not require additions or corrections. It's probably needless to say that you should not assume that these people are in total agreement with the scientific purposes views expressed in this book; and are not responsible for any errors or obscurities that you might accidentally find in it.
	
	Thanks also to the few colleagues and customers who were willing to give me their comments to improve the content of this book. However, it is certain that it can still be improved on many points.
	
	I would like finally to thank especially all of my family for their continued support and my friends for their patience as I was almost completely absent, but I would like to send a special thanks to my Dad and Mom, for all of her incredibly help and support over the last months of translation of this book! I would like also to apologize to some of my customers and colleagues because as I answered very slowly to their e-mails and phones during thirteen months to better focus on the translation of this book. Thanks also to my girlfriend for always being there to take care of me when I forget to take care of myself...
	
	I would sincerely appreciate your comments, criticisms, corrections and suggestions for improving the text, for this purpose you can use the public guestbook associated to this PDF (for questions please use the forum!):
	\begin{center}

 	\chapter{Epilogue}
	You have traveled a long distance with us through this book. We have now reached the epilogue, where by tradition, the main redactor is allowed to give voice its own personal opinions. 

	Indeed, I want to leave you with some of my thoughts on theory versus practice, business and engineering education, applied mathematics research, and what I hope you will take with you after having read this book.
	
	By nature, academic engineering is very closely related to its practice. Theory and practice are ruled by the same ideas. As an academic myself teaching since 2001 in Fortune 500 and SME companies, I am proud to claim that the majority of engineering ideas were either invented or developed in academia first before they crossed over into practice.
	
	But engineering research is not just for aspiring academics: As i know it very well management and economics consultants are basically researchers even if most of them have a very low analytic level. Firms like McKinsey, Ernst \& Young, KPMG and Accenture may have different audiences, production speeds, team systems, and publication and evaluation processes, but they research the same issues that academics do and with the same methods at the exception that the level is significantly lower.

	There is also much cross-fertilization: Many professors work regularly with major consulting in USA or asset-investment firms and some have even quit academia altogether to quadruple their pay (or increase their global hapiness...).

	Because engineering is by nature such an applied discipline, after reading this book, you should probably not need anything else to understand engineering research today. In an ideal World, you should be able to read the current state-of-the-art research right now.
	
	So, do we really understand engineering? Certainly not fully! We haven seen through this book that finance is as much an art as it is a science. Given our deficiencies, given that all our methods have their errors, what should we do? My best advice to you is to use common sense, to employ a number of different techniques to come up with a range of possible answers, avoid cognitive biases, and to then make a judgment at the end of the day as to what estimate appears most reasonable in light of different models and your peer-reviewers.
	
	Our book has covered the principles of engineering in some depth and breadth. You should be very well prepared now for the next steps in your lifetime engineering education.
	
	I have enjoyed writing this book in the same way that I enjoy writing my training books, and pretty much for the same reason: It has been like solving an intriguing puzzle that no one else has figured out in quite the same way a particular way to see and explain finance. Of course, writing it has taken me quite a long times (20 years, without translation: 15 years!).
	
	But it will all have been worth it if you have learned from it. If you have studied the book, you should now know about $99\%$ of what I know about engineering. Interestingly, there were a number of topics that I thought I had understood, but had not - and it was only my having to explain them to you that clarified them for me, too. And this brings me to a key point that I want to leave you with - never be afraid to ask questions, even about first principles. To do so is not a sign of stupidity on the contrary, it is often a sign of deepening awareness and understanding.

	I have no illusions: You will not remember all the fine details in this book as time passes - I know I won't. But more than the details, I hope that I will have left you with an appreciation for the big ideas, an arsenal of tools, a method for approaching novel problems, and a new perspective. You can now think like an Engineer or even better: as a Scientist!

	\begin{fquote}[Richard Feynman]Physics is like sex. Sure it may have some practical results, but that's not why we do it.
 	\end{fquote}
 	
	\begin{fquote}[Martin Gardner]Mathematics is not only real, but it is the only reality. That is that entire universe is made of matter, obviously. And matter is made of particles. It's made of electrons and neutrons and protons. So the entire universe is made out of particles. Now what are the particles made out of? They're not made out of anything. The only thing you can say about the reality of an electron is to cite its mathematical properties. So there's a sense in which matter has completely dissolved and what is left is just a mathematical structure.
 	\end{fquote}
 	
 	\begin{fquote}[Owen Chamberlain]Each generation of scientists stands upon the shoulders of those who have gone before.
 	\end{fquote}
 	
 	\begin{fquote}[Kiyoshi Ito]In precisely built mathematical structures, mathematicians find the same sort of beauty others find in enchanting pieces of music, or in magnificent architecture. There is however, one great difference between the beauty of mathematical structures and that of great art. Music by Mozart, for instance, impress greatly even those who do not know musical theory; the cathedral in Cologne overwhelms spectators even if they know nothing about Christianity. The beauty in mathematical structures, however, cannot be appreciated without understanding of a group of numerical formulae that express laws of logic. Only mathematicians can read "musical scores" containing many numerical formulae, and play that "music" in their hearts.

	\defbibnote{myprenote}{Since this work is a reference, we have opted to exclude any reference in the text. So we simply gathered a final bibliography list according to a ranking of use and unassuming it's completeness.

The books and documents listed below are what I consider as the best references (thus excluding the free PDFs) which have been consulted for the preparation of this book and who is indebted to many high quality borrows. Their reading can be as profitable for all who wish to improve, deepen and broaden their knowledge. 

Numerous references, however, are no longer available on the market and it is also necessary that the reader remembers that each entry in the table by itself refers to dozens of other books, it is also impossible to have an exhaustive and objective list (that would be a vicious cycle) of all high-quality books existing in the areas covered by Sciences.ch.

And here is the complete list:}

	{\LARGE Elementary Applied Mathematics for Engineers}

	{\color{white}The purpose of this book and its associated PDF is to present to people who approach the study of Applied Mathematics, their basic concepts and to do so with some level of rigour (demonstrations are complete or at least pushed to the point where there can reasonably be judged to be), details and consistency in respect of writing conventions and with a maximum of pedagogy. This book is also born from the desire to present some scientific ideas and understand how they modestly affect our lifestyle, our way of thinking, working and their impact on our ecosystem and the unreasonable effectiveness of Applied Mathematics. Indeed, issues related to science are becoming increasingly important in our contemporary culture and represent a major challenge in terms of ethics, citizenship and development.

	This book is not intended to be a novel to read from start to the end. It is intended as a reference book (after all errors have been corrected and texts completed...) which, when simple questions arise, to find answers quickly using computer technology and for free. This book cannot (and does not) also claim to replace a formal school education with a teacher and numerous practical exercises. It can however be seen as a formulas reference (with proofs) or a relatively good theoretical complement to the preparation of various examinations.

	The view point that is adopted is that of the pragmatic engineer, eager to study mathematics, classical physics, econometrics, numerical analysis, statistics, relativistic mechanics, quantum physics, social mathematics, computer science, chemistry, etc. in a concise way and without wasting time in a formal and extravagant vocabulary and unusable in modern industry. From this point of view the concepts and methods presented are just some of the typical tools mathematical-physical (absolute minimum in the field). The specialist expert will find nothing new and the student who would be interested in a particular theory should know that every subject is unfortunately much larger than anything that can be discussed here so far... The ambition is not one we can have for students of a course of mathematics for whom the acquisition of tools is important. This makes possible a little formal style where one wishes to give evidence less complete than to intuitively understand the objects presented, to see them and own them.

	We dedicate this book to all those for which each answer is a question.
