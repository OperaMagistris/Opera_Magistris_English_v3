%Coordinator: Vincent ISOZ
%Last Update: 2021-12-26
%Contact: info@sciences.ch
%Compiled on: TeXMaker 5.1.1 x64 / MiKTeX 2.9 / Packages Update 2021-11-17 / Microsoft Windows Pro 10.0.19041 x64/PC 64GB RAM (recommended 32 GB at least otherwise the document could not compiled correctly or not at all without disabling the List of Figures and List of Tables!)

%Remarks: 

%R1. The tkz-tab and etex packages must be installed manually from the MikTeX Package Manager!!!

%R2. When you install first MiKTeX and after TeXMaker don't forget to reboot the computer. Compile the document (probably will fail first time...). Do an update of packages using the MiKTeX package updater. Try compile again and use once again de MiKTeX package updater. And it should work! If it still doesn't work I have noticed that sometimes corrupted images cause the compilation to not be possible. 

%R3. Compile the document consecutively five times at least to get a publishable version!

%R4. Try using a less as possible styles and math operators to avoid confusion (thanks).

%R5. Since 2015-08-29 the ctable package makes conflicts and therefore you can't compile the document with it anymore. We have commented it.

%R6. When the MikTeX Updater updates the BibTex package, then you have to remove all temporary compilation files of the book to be able to compile it again.

%R7. Above 2,600 pages the MikTeX compilation reach TeX memory limit. You will get the message:
%TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [main memory size=3000000]
%To solve this open a command Window or the PowerShell and enter:
%initexmf --edit-config-file=pdflatex
%Add the following line in the new document that appears on the screen (remove the percent symbol at the beginning of each line!):
%pool_size=6000000
%main_memory=7000000
%extra_mem_bot=3000000
%font_mem_size=3000000
%and save it (ctrl+s) and quit the editor. After rebuild the format with:
%initexmf --dump=pdflatex
%that's it!!!!

%R8. To remove all equations in Notepad++ with a RegEx, use:
% (?s)\\begin\{gather\}.*?\\end\{gather\}
%don't forget to activate the field ". match newlines"

 	\chapter{Epilogue}
	You have travelled a long distance with us through this book. We have now reached the epilogue, where by tradition, the main redactor is allowed to give voice its own personal opinions. 

	Indeed, I want to leave you with some of my thoughts on theory versus practice, business and engineering education, applied mathematics research, and what I hope you will take with you after having read this book.
	
	By nature, academic engineering is very closely related to its practice. Theory and practice are ruled by the same ideas. As an academic myself teaching since 2001 in Fortune 500 and SME companies, I am proud to claim that the majority of engineering ideas were either invented or developed in academia first before they crossed over into practice.
	
	But engineering research is not just for aspiring academics: As I know it very well management and economics consultants are basically researchers even if most of them have a very low analytic level. Firms like McKinsey, Ernst \& Young, KPMG and Accenture may have different audiences, production speeds, team systems, and publication and evaluation processes, but they research the same issues that academics do and with the same methods at the exception that the level is significantly lower.

	There is also much cross-fertilization: Many professors work regularly with major consulting in USA or asset-investment firms and some have even quit academia altogether to quadruple their pay (or increase their global happiness...).

	Because engineering is by nature such an applied discipline, after reading this book, you should probably not need anything else to understand engineering research today. In an ideal World, you should be able to read the current state-of-the-art research right now.
	
	So, do we really understand engineering? Certainly not fully! We haven seen through this book that finance is as much an art as it is a science. Given our deficiencies, given that all our methods have their errors, what should we do? My best advice to you is to use common sense, to employ a number of different techniques to come up with a range of possible answers, avoid cognitive biases, and to then make a judgement at the end of the day as to what estimate appears most reasonable in light of different models and your peer-reviewers.
	
	Our book has covered the principles of engineering in some depth and breadth. You should be very well prepared now for the next steps in your lifetime engineering education.
	
	I have enjoyed writing this book in the same way that I enjoy writing my training books, and pretty much for the same reason: It has been like solving an intriguing puzzle that no one else has figured out in quite the same way a particular way to see and explain finance. Of course, writing it has taken me quite a long times (20 years, without translation: 15 years!).
	
	But it will all have been worth it if you have learned from it. If you have studied the book, you should now know about $99\%$ of what I know about engineering. Interestingly, there were a number of topics that I thought I had understood, but had not - and it was only my having to explain them to you that clarified them for me, too. And this brings me to a key point that I want to leave you with - never be afraid to ask questions, even about first principles. To do so is not a sign of stupidity on the contrary, it is often a sign of deepening awareness and understanding.

	I have no illusions: You will not remember all the fine details in this book as time passes - I know I won't. But more than the details, I hope that I will have left you with an appreciation for the big ideas, an arsenal of tools, a method for approaching novel problems, and a new perspective. You can now think like an Engineer or even better: as a Scientist!

	\defbibnote{myprenote}{Since this work is a reference, we have tried  to exclude as many external references as possible in the texts. So we simply gathered a final bibliography list according to a ranking of use and unassuming it's completeness.

	The books and documents in french, english and german listed below are what we consider as the best references (thus excluding the free PDFs) which have been consulted for the preparation of this book and who is indebted to many high quality borrows. Their reading can be as profitable for all who wish to improve, deepen and broaden their knowledge. 

	Numerous references, however, are no longer available on the market and it is also necessary that the reader remembers that each entry in the table by itself refers to dozens of other books, it is also impossible to have an exhaustive and objective list (that would be a vicious cycle) of all high-quality books existing in the areas covered by \textit{Opera Magistris}.

And here is the complete list:}

	{\LARGE Elementary Applied Mathematics for Engineers}

	{\color{white}The purpose of this book and its associated PDF is to present to people who approach the study of Applied Mathematics, their basic concepts and to do so with some level of rigour (demonstrations are complete or at least pushed to the point where there can reasonably be judged to be), details and consistency in respect of writing conventions and with a maximum of pedagogy. This book is also born from the desire to present some scientific ideas and understand how they modestly affect our lifestyle, our way of thinking, working and their impact on our ecosystem and the unreasonable effectiveness of Applied Mathematics. Indeed, issues related to science are becoming increasingly important in our contemporary culture and represent a major challenge in terms of ethics, citizenship and development.

	This book is not intended to be a novel to read from start to the end. It is intended as a reference book (after all errors have been corrected and texts completed...) which, when simple questions arise, to find answers quickly using computer technology and for free. This book cannot (and does not) also claim to replace a formal school education with a teacher and numerous practical exercises. It can however be seen as a formulas reference (with proofs) or a relatively good theoretical complement to the preparation of various examinations.

	The view point that is adopted is that of the pragmatic engineer, eager to study mathematics, classical physics, econometrics, numerical analysis, statistics, relativistic mechanics, quantum physics, social mathematics, computer science, chemistry, etc. in a concise way and without wasting time in a formal and extravagant vocabulary and unusable in modern industry. From this point of view the concepts and methods presented are just some of the typical tools mathematical-physical (absolute minimum in the field). The specialist expert will find nothing new and the student who would be interested in a particular theory should know that every subject is unfortunately much larger than anything that can be discussed here so far... The ambition is not one we can have for students of a course of mathematics for whom the acquisition of tools is important. This makes possible a little formal style where one wishes to give evidence less complete than to intuitively understand the objects presented, to see them and own them.

	We dedicate this book to all those for which each answer is a question.
