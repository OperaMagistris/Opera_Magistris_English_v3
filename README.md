# opera_magistris
repository for the LaTeX source code and illustrations of the Opera Magistris compendium

To avoid that teachers around the world recreate the wheel it seemed important to us to create a LaTeX compendium with the basic scientific knowledge of the 21st century that can be reuse for free for teaching purposes.

As holy books (Bible, Quran, and so on...) are freely avalaible in many hotels, streets and libraries around the world it seemd also obvious to us to have and equivalent for pure science.

The source code and text is under Public License and therefore can be used, translated and distributed at free will.

It is only banned to use the text and content for religious propaganda.
