	We summarize here the different quotes that are in the various chapters of this book. We added also below some quotes that may be useful when debating some scientifically illiterate people who use quotes to back-up their claims (as these people assume that a quote has a scientific evidence level other than zero...).
	
	\begin{fquote}[Wilson Mizner]If you steal from one author, it's plagiarism; if you steal from many, it's research!
 	\end{fquote}
	
	\begin{fquote}[James D. Eckard]We are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly as possible, because only in that way can we find progress!

 	\begin{fquote}[Carl Sagan]You can't convince a believer of anything; for their belief is not based on evidence, it's based on a deep seated need to believe.

 	\end{fquote}
 	
 	\begin{fquote}[Steven Weinberg]Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it, you'd have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, it takes religion!

 	\end{fquote}
 	
 	\begin{fquote}[Carl Sagan] Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
 	\end{fquote}
 	
 	\begin{fquote}[Richard Leakey]I have your letter and the best thing I can do is refer to my published works, both scientific and popular. The creationist movement is lead by a dishonest bunch of operators and misquotation is the hall mark of their work. Responding to them is time wasting and a letter would not be adequate to put your questions to rest. There are some things best ignored and the stupidity of these so called religious fanatics continues to astonish me.
 	\end{fquote}
 	
 	\begin{fquote}[L. Aron Nelson]Most people don't really want the truth; they just want reassurance that what they already believe, is the truth.

	\begin{fquote}[Richard Feynman]Physics is like sex. Sure it may have some practical results, but that's not why we do it.
 	\end{fquote}
 	
	\begin{fquote}[Martin Gardner]Mathematics is not only real, but it is the only reality. That is that entire universe is made of matter, obviously. And matter is made of particles. It's made of electrons and neutrons and protons. So the entire universe is made out of particles. Now what are the particles made out of? They're not made out of anything. The only thing you can say about the reality of an electron is to cite its mathematical properties. So there's a sense in which matter has completely dissolved and what is left is just a mathematical structure.
 	\end{fquote}
 	
 	\begin{fquote}[Owen Chamberlain]Each generation of scientists stands upon the shoulders of those who have gone before.
 	\end{fquote}
 	
 	\begin{fquote}[Kiyoshi Ito]In precisely built mathematical structures, mathematicians find the same sort of beauty others find in enchanting pieces of music, or in magnificent architecture. There is however, one great difference between the beauty of mathematical structures and that of great art. Music by Mozart, for instance, impress greatly even those who do not know musical theory; the cathedral in Cologne overwhelms spectators even if they know nothing about Christianity. The beauty in mathematical structures, however, cannot be appreciated without understanding of a group of numerical formulae that express laws of logic. Only mathematicians can read "musical scores" containing many numerical formulae, and play that "music" in their hearts.
 	\end{fquote}

 	\end{fquote}
 	
 	\begin{fquote}[Charles Darwin]Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.

 	\begin{fquote}Differentiation is a science, Integration is an art.

 	\end{fquote}
 	
	\begin{fquote}[Stephen Hawking]One can't prove that God doesn't exists, but Science makes God unnecessary.

 	\end{fquote}
 	
 	\begin{fquote}[Ronald Fisher]To call in the statistician after the experiment is done may be no more than asking him to perform a post-mortem examination: he may be able to say what the experiment died of...
 	\end{fquote}
 	
 	\begin{fquote}[Charles Babbage]Errors using inadequate data are much less than those using no data at all!

 	\begin{fquote}[John von Neuman]The sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to interpret, they mainly makes models.
